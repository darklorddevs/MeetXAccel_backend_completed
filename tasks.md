# Calendly Clone Frontend Development Tasks

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive, phased approach for developing an enterprise-grade frontend that fully leverages every aspect of the sophisticated Django REST API backend. The frontend will be built with Next.js 14+, TypeScript, and the Subtle Slate theme for a professional, modern scheduling platform.

## Theme: Subtle Slate Professional

**Design Philosophy:**
- **Light-first design** with sophisticated gray tones
- **High contrast** for accessibility and readability
- **Clean typography** with proper hierarchy
- **Subtle animations** and micro-interactions
- **Professional depth** through shadows and layering
- **Consistent spacing** using 8px grid system

**Color System:**
- Primary: Light grays (#F8FAFC to #020617) for backgrounds and structure
- Accent: Vibrant blues, emeralds, oranges for actions and highlights
- Neutral: Pure whites to dark grays for content and text
- Semantic: Success (emerald), Error (red), Warning (orange), Info (blue)
